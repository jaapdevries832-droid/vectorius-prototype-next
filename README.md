# Vectorius â€” Refactored MVP Scaffold

This package reorganizes your Lesson_6 code into a clean structure and adds boilerplate for DB migrations, schema snapshots, seed data, and onboarding docs.

## Structure
```
/web            # Next.js/React frontend
/db/migrations  # SQL migrations (DDL + RLS)
/db/schema      # Schema dumps (dated)
/db/seed        # Test/sample data
/docs           # Onboarding docs
```
See `/docs/ONBOARDING.md` for run and migration steps.
